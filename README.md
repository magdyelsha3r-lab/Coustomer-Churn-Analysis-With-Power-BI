# README: Customer Churn Analysis with Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn (attrition rate) to identify the key reasons behind customer departures and offer actionable insights. **Power BI** was utilized to visualize the data and create an interactive dashboard that highlights major trends, churn distribution across categories, demographics, and account factors.

## 🎯 Key Analysis Objectives

* [cite_start]Calculate the overall Churn Rate and the total number of churned customers[cite: 1, 21, 24].
* [cite_start]Identify and categorize the main reasons for churn (e.g., Competitor, Attitude, Dissatisfaction, Price)[cite: 29, 31].
* [cite_start]Analyze specific churn reasons and their frequency (e.g., better deals from competitors, attitude of support person, high price)[cite: 4, 5, 6].
* [cite_start]Explore the relationship between churn rate and factors like Account Length, Contract Type, and Grouped Data Consumption[cite: 41, 73].
* [cite_start]Analyze churn based on demographics (Age bins) and customer segments (Senior, Under 30, Other)[cite: 161, 162, 184].
* [cite_start]Identify the states with the highest churn rates (e.g., OH, OR, AL)[cite: 37, 87, 90, 93, 96].

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

* **Analysis and Visualization Tool:** Power BI (used to create the interactive dashboard).
* **Data:** Customer Churn Analysis Dataset (reflected in the provided report visuals).

## 💡 Key Findings and Insights

Based on the visual analysis from the Power BI dashboard, the following conclusions were drawn:

* [cite_start]**Overall Churn Rate:** The total customer churn rate is **26.86%** [cite: 1, 37, 153][cite_start], with **1796** customers churned out of **6687** total customers[cite: 21, 24, 38, 39, 154].
* **Churn Category Distribution:**
    * [cite_start]**Competitor** is the overwhelming primary reason, accounting for **46%** of all churn[cite: 29, 30, 31].
    * [cite_start]**Attitude** and **Dissatisfaction** each account for **16%** of churn[cite: 26, 28, 32, 33].
    * [cite_start]**Price** and **Other** reasons each account for **11%**[cite: 25, 27, 34, 35].
* **Specific Churn Reasons (Top 3):**
    * [cite_start]"Competitor had better de..." is the most frequent specific reason with **297** occurrences[cite: 5, 6].
    * [cite_start]"Attitude of support person" is the second, with **203** occurrences[cite: 5, 7].
    * [cite_start]"Don't know" is the third, with **123** occurrences[cite: 8, 9].
* [cite_start]**Contract Type and Churn:** The Month-to-Month contract category is likely associated with higher churn rates compared to yearly contracts, as suggested by the visualization (though specific rates are not fully visible in the graph, the churn rate for Monthly is 31.28% vs. Yearly 11.29% elsewhere)[cite: 169, 170, 171, 172].
* [cite_start]**Demographics (Age):** Customers categorized as **"senior"** have the highest churn percentage at **45%** in the demographic breakdown[cite: 162, 166]. [cite_start]Churn rate (black line) shows a sharp increase at higher age bins[cite: 184, 191].

## 📝 Actionable Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are suggested to mitigate customer churn:

* [cite_start]**Combat Competition:** The company must urgently review competitor offerings and improve its packages or provide retention incentives, given that the Competitor category is the largest driver of churn (46%)[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Enhance Customer Service Quality:** Since "Attitude of support person" is the second most cited specific reason [cite: 5, 7][cite_start], investing in support staff training and improving the quality of service is critical to address churn caused by Attitude (16%)[cite: 26, 32].
* [cite_start]**Target Senior Customers:** Develop dedicated retention programs and loyalty schemes specifically targeting the **"senior"** customer segment, as they represent the highest demographic churn group (45%)[cite: 166].
* [cite_start]**Pricing Strategy Review:** Re-evaluate the pricing structure for higher-cost plans or low-usage customers, as "Price too high" is a contributing factor[cite: 15, 16].
